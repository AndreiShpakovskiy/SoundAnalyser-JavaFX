# SoundAnalyser-JavaFX

This project is very basic sandbox for training DSP skills in direction of sound analysis and recognition.

At the moment the app contains the following functionality:
1. Signal loading and viewing in both time and frequency domain.
2. Audio source recognotion (on the way, current progress can be tracked in a corresponding branch).
